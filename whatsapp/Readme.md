1. No saved state - Everything is stored at client side
2. Only thing server stores is User information, list of friends and groups
3. All Chats and Presence servers are stateless and can be scaled horizontally
4. A message from User_NorthAmerica to User_APAC is essentially a routing between 2 chat servers located in different regions of the world
5.
